# Analyze A/B Test Results Project
Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree - Project 3

## Overview
A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. It is important that I get some practice working with the difficulties of these.

For this project, I will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. My goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

The data, the Jupyter Notebook, Python, LaTex, and some libraries that what I need to complete the project.

## Statistical Analysis
- Bootstrapping sampling distributions and p-value calculations.
- Z-core tests.
- Logistic regression.
- Multiple linear regression modelling to assess for interactions of independent variables.

## Key Findings
- The conversion rate for the new page was not superior to that for the old page.
- The country of the user did not impact the rate of conversion between the new and old page.
